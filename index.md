## Project Description

The food ordering and delivery system will be an online application for customers to make orders on registered restaurants. There are three types of users: customers, restaurant owners and delivery guys. All users will have a unique username and log in with their username and password. Users will have additional information such as their name, email and birthdate. Customers can make orders, review them and mark restaurants as their favorite restaurants. Customers will be able to review both the restaurant and the driver. Customers can add more than one address and phone information to the system and choose a delivery address from those. Restaurant owners can register their restaurants to the system, add food and beverages for their restaurant and create menus from them for customers to order. Restaurant owners will be able to specify the category of the food they add. Restaurants can also view reviews for their restaurant and give responses to them. Restaurants will have average ratings for the food they serve to create an impression on the customers. Additionally, each restaurant will have one address to group the restaurants in the same region. The system will organize the delivery by randomly assigning the order to an available driver.
